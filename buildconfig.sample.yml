# IMPORTANT: All references to the Xcode project file must use the new unified project file (e.g., SampleProject.xcodeproj).
# Do NOT reference any old or legacy Xcode project files. Update all build_command and outputs accordingly.
#
# Example:
#   build_command: xcodebuild -project SampleProject.xcodeproj -scheme "SampleProject macOS" -configuration ${CONFIGURATION}
#
# This ensures the build system always uses the correct, current project structure.
#
# NOTE ON always_run:
#   Setting always_run: true ensures a task or platform always runs when invoked,
#   but ONLY if it is included in the build order (either explicitly as a target or as a dependency).
#   If a platform or task is not in the build order, always_run has no effect.
# Sample build configuration

# Build Groups
# Build Groups define collections of platforms that can be built together.
# A target can be a specific platform name or a build group name.
# Each group can have its own continue_on_error setting for hierarchical error handling.
#
# continue_on_error: fail-fast setting for groups
#   - true: try all sub-targets, but group fails if any fail
#   - false: halt group on first failure
#
# Use cases:
# - Set to false for sequential workflows where each step depends on the previous
# - Set to true for parallel builds or when you want partial results
# - Set to true for CI/CD where you want to see all failures at once

# Multi-Argument Task Example
#
# To pass multiple arguments to a task, use the 'args' field in a build group target.
# You can specify arguments as a YAML list (for positional args) or as a mapping (for key=value pairs):
#
# Example (list):
#   - name: increment-version
#     args: [patch, macOS]
#
# Example (mapping):
#   - name: custom-task
#     args:
#       platform: iOS
#       foo: bar
#
# Both forms are supported. The build system will pass these as positional or environment variables to the task script.
#
# See the 'demo_group' below for more examples.

# ---
# In the tasks section, document how arguments are received:
#
# - For positional args (YAML list), the first is exported as $type, the second as $platform, etc.
# - For mapping args, each key is exported as an environment variable.
#
# Example task definition:
#   - name: increment-version
#     description: "Increment version for a specific platform and type"
#     command: "./Scripts/increment_version.sh ${type} ${platform}"
#
#   - name: custom-task
#     description: "Demo task for argument passing"
#     command: "echo Platform is ${platform}, Foo is ${foo}"
# ---
#
# --- Instance Support Documentation ---
#
# The build system supports multiple instances of the same task within a group using a hybrid approach:
#
# 1. **Implicit References (Default)**: When you specify `depends: F`, it references the most recent
#    instance of F in the same group context.
#
# 2. **Explicit References**: When you specify `depends: { name: F, instance: "first" }`, it references
#    the specific instance with that instance ID.
#
# 3. **Special Keywords**: You can use "@first" and "@last" to reference the first or most recent
#    instance of a task.
#
# 4. **Instance Declaration**: Use `instance: "identifier"` to create a named instance of a task.
#
# Example:
#   - name: F
#     instance: "setup"      # Creates instance "setup" of task F
#   - name: B
#     depends: F             # Implicit: depends on most recent F (setup)
#   - name: F
#     instance: "cleanup"    # Creates instance "cleanup" of task F
#   - name: C
#     depends: F             # Implicit: depends on most recent F (cleanup)
#   - name: D
#     depends:               # Explicit: depends on specific instance
#       - name: F
#         instance: "setup"
#   - name: E
#     depends:               # Using special keywords
#       - name: F
#         instance: "@first"  # First instance (setup)
#       - name: F
#         instance: "@last"   # Most recent instance (cleanup)
